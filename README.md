Advice Giver Application - Front End Architect Ben-Griffin

This app creates room for an online global community just for you to connect with, and only one call away! You can choose to be the expert advisor, or the one who receives advice, or both! If you get a match, you both decide how to engage in the advisory relationship, assess if the advice is helpful or not, and when to move onâ€”sounds like a normal relationship, right?
Try it out! And leave no one behind, because a more connected world should never feel lonely for anyone.
